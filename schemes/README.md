# ðŸ“¦ Hardware Documentation and Setup Guide

This autonomous robot consists of two processing units â€” a Raspberry Pi and a LEGO EV3 Brick. The chassis is based on a modified LEGO EV3 Ackermann steering platform. The robot is equipped with multiple sensors and motors and is controlled by a computer vision algorithm for obstacle avoidance and lap counting.
