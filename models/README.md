# 3D Models

This project does not use any custom 3D-printed parts.

All hardware components were assembled using standard LEGO Mindstorms EV3 parts, motors, and sensors. Therefore, no 3D modeling or printing was required during development.

## Components Used

- LEGO EV3 Brick
- LEGO Medium Motors (2x)
- LEGO Ultrasonic Sensors (2x)
- LEGO Color Sensor
- LEGO Touch Sensor (optional, depending on version)
- Raspberry Pi (connected via USB to EV3)
- USB Camera (or CSI Camera Module for Raspberry Pi)
- LEGO Technic parts for structural support

## Optional Resources

If needed, standard 3D/CAD models of these components can be downloaded from:

- Raspberry Pi: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#3d-models
- LEGO EV3 parts: https://www.ldraw.org/
- BrickLink Studio parts library (for LEGO CAD modeling): https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page
- GrabCAD LEGO collection: https://grabcad.com/library/tag/lego

## Summary

No 3D-printed parts were used in this project. All mechanical assemblies were built from pre-existing LEGO components and electronics.
